# Object Detection with Drone
 
This project test the capability for computer vision using DJI's consumer drones, to do near-real-time computer vision. It takes advantage of DJI's advanced long distance video transmission link, and shows how to capture the frame from live video feed. With this you can do any computer vision and machine learning tricks you like on drone's video feed, thre are vast application for this.  
  
## Equipments:  
DJI Spark  
Mobile Phone  
Laptop  
  
## How to build  
1. Install and run a RTMP server on your laptop, you can use nginx, a lightweight web server to host RTMP streams
2. Setup hotspot on the laptop and connect the mobile phone to the hotspot  
3. Forward drone's video livestream through RTMP server over hotspot  
4. Access video stream from RTMP server  
5. Clone this repo and run the code in terminal/Python IDE.
